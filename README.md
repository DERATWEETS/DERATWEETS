---> I joined Web3 space over 14 months now and currently 
I’ve learned a lot about CRYPTO,DEFI and AIRDROPS,which 
I am looking forward to learning more and at same time training as many as possible that i come across. 
But to finalize it, Am a strictly business man. 
I’ve worked as a moderator/community Manager in some few project like ( Saudis NFT ) but my cooperation is over with them, 
looking forward to do more. My start was also from Fiverr as a content writer and web designer but currently, 
I base on research analysis not too serious though, cus I’ve come along great opportunities in Web3 space. 
So am basically using my skills in Web3 fully.
